EIN : Rn we have downloaded many packaged, react-hook-form, html-react-parser, tinymce-react, appwrite, their purpose would be revealed as we make the project.
.env, this is where we set "enviornment variables". React se banaoge toh REACT_APP_ lagaane padta hai, par hamne vite se banaya, to VITE_ lagao. Acess keliye import.meta.env.<naman>. .env file ko git-ignore mein daalna hai, aur github pe push karne keliye ek .env.sample banana hai jismein content same hoga. 
Abhi appwrite mein kaafi kuch banaya hai jiska deadass mujhe koi anuman nahi hai, we will see as the project progresses. 
conf.js file has been created to ensure that the enviornment variable loaded is a string without fail and makes the access part easier
